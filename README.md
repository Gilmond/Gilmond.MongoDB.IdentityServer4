# IdentityServer4.MongoDB

## Goal

The intent with this project is to create a NoSql (MongoDB) implementation of both Configuration and Operational state for IdentityServer4.

The codebase is written against the latest stable .Net SDK (back to csproj...), but will otherwise conform where possible with the IdentityServer4 standards.

I see the project going one of two ways; either the repository will be adopted into the IS4 ecosystem, to which I'll happily transfer ownership of the repository to IdentityServer Organisation. However, if Brock/Dominick don't want anything to do with these shennanigans, I'll drop all the copyright headers and change the package/repository names to make it clear Brock/Dominick aren't to blame for this NoSQL mess. :)

For the time being, I'll keep this repository private, and hopefully borrow some expertise and time from @herecydev.
